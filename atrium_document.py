"""
atrium_document.py  –  Per-document aggregate record for ATRIUM pipelines (record schema 2.0).

Where a step's paradata answer *how a run behaved*, this answers *what we know about one
document*: the identity of the file, its text in a form the enrichment steps work on, and what
they add. It holds CONTENT ONLY (doc-schema-v2, atrium-project#84): no run data, no licence, no
copy of the layout.

The tools are separate containers and never see each other's outputs, so the record is built
by **accretion**: every tool takes the previous version of the JSON (if it is given one) and
returns it with **only its own block(s)** updated. Nothing else is touched.

    seed ──► [record builder] ──► doc.json ──► [nlp-enrich] ──► doc.json ──► …
              pages, lines, content            its fields only

Contract (see docs/document_schema.md):
  1. Optional baseline in, updated record out. `doc_id` travels WITH the baseline: the seed (or,
     outside the pilot, the first tool) names the document, every stage after it inherits.
  2. A tool writes its own block(s) and fields only; every other block is passed through untouched.
  3. No baseline given → the tool emits just its own part (standalone-safe).
  4. The record carries no run data: which run wrote which blocks and fields is named by that
     run's paradata `result` (`DocumentRecord.written()` gives it), never by a stamp in the record.
  5. No licence is computed or written anywhere (D2): components and their terms are paradata.
  6. Unknown or newer blocks of the same major are preserved; a newer major is refused; an older
     major is migrated on load (`migrate_document()`).

The positional blocks — `pages`, `content`, `lines` — have ONE writer, the record builder
(ocr-postprocess), which builds them from the document's stored `atr/docproc-json` whatever
produced it (digital-convert, the ATR, the PCSS converter). The layout itself (blocks, tables,
reading-order roles, page verdicts) stays in docproc; each line names its docproc block
(`lines[].block`), its text source and how precise its box is (D16, D20, D25, D26).

A record may start as an AMČR **seed** (atrium-project#71): `doc_id`, and a `source` with the
archive's `sha512`, file name and media type, nothing else. A seed is valid INPUT, checked by
`validate_seed()` (and by `validate_baseline()`, which every tool's inherited-baseline gate calls);
a record a tool EMITS is always checked against the full schema.

Two things the JSON Schema deliberately cannot check, and where they live instead:

  * a field-ownership drop — `lines[]` requires only `page`+`line`, so a row stripped of its
    `text` by `merge_block()` is a *valid* row. Use `assert_fields_survived()` (or
    `dropped_fields()`) right after a merge; `warn_dropped_fields=True` turns it on globally.
  * the schema itself being reachable — `schema_path()` / `load_schema()` /
    `validate_document()` resolve it next to whichever copy of this module was vendored.

        WHY THE BASELINE WINS (atrium-project#10, D1's second half). `__init__` used to do a
        bare ``self._data["doc_id"] = doc_id`` — the caller's derivation overwrote the key the
        deep-copied baseline had arrived with, without so much as comparing them. That is a
        FORK: every block already in ``self._data`` was written under the baseline's id, so
        re-stamping the record with a different one hands the next stage a document whose
        contents belong to a document it has never heard of. The E2E gate is where it finally
        surfaced (hub run 31076188660): stage 3 emitted ``CTX000000003-1`` into a chain whose
        other four stages all said ``CTX000000003``.

        The caller's value is a GUESS FROM A LOCAL FILENAME, and the pipeline routinely feeds a
        stage something other than the original: the translator's real input is
        ``PAGE_ALTO/<doc>/<doc>-1.alto.xml``, a page alto-postprocess split out, so
        ``canonical_doc_id()`` correctly answers ``<doc>-1`` — correct for that FILE, wrong for
        the RECORD. No filename heuristic can close that gap in general (a document may legally
        be named ``sbn.2019-1``); the baseline can, because it carries the answer explicitly.
        So the rule is not "derive it more cleverly" but "do not re-derive what you were told":
        the originator names the document, every later stage inherits that name, and
        ``canonical_doc_id()`` decides only for a run that has no baseline at all (rule 3).

        The divergence is still worth saying out loud — it usually means a tool's own naming
        disagrees with the pipeline's — but it is not an error and never fatal: the record that
        comes out is the correct one, and raising here (even under ``strict``) would stall a
        pipeline over an id this method has just repaired. Compare
        ``merge_document_records()``, which DOES raise on differing doc_ids: there the ids
